# Assignment 1, March 4th, 2020

I never really liked school, so whenever I had a chance I would try to miss school and go somewhere else. One day I missed school with some stupid excuse and went walking with a good friend, we were used to walked a lot, and the basic idea was to go as far as we could and go back, breaking the record every time.

On that day I went as far as one of the cemeteries in my town. I already knew the place, one of my close uncles were berried there and went there so see his grace, that would be my record distance for that day. But when I came there I noticed the picture in his grave were missing, so I started to look around and finally found it.

At first I thought I would just leave it there but I realized it might get lost forever by leaving it loose there, so I decided to take the picture with me and 'save the day'. So I went back and straight to my aunt's house and thought I would a hero for saving the picture. She started yelling me that I should never should have done that and asked me to immediately go to his mother in law, my uncles' mother to give her the picture so she can get it back.

The picture was printed in some ceramic part, and on my way to my uncle's mother house I dropped it and the picture broke in many parts.

I started crying immediately. My 'hero day' was over and it turned into a very bad and sad memory. Many years later I figured out that the picture was restored and I was not cursed for the rest of my life.
